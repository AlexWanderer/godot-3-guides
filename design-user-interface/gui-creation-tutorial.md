# Design the GUI

Now you nailed the basics, we're going to see how to build a Game User Interface with reusable UI components: a life bar, an energy bar, a bomb and a rupee counter.

For the game user interface, we won the bars aligned on the left side and the counters on the right side of the screen. The margin should be fixed.
We don’t need the interface to be as flexible as a website. In the majority of games, you don’t want to support both landscape and portrait screen orientations. It’s one of the other. That’s why it’s enough for the GUI elements to only move horizontally when we change the window size. In landscape position, the most common ratios range from 4:3 16:10.
