# Introduction to the Animation Tools

Godot's animation system allows you to control any property you can find on any nodes in your scene. This means you can not only animates values that are visual in nature, like the position, the rotation, the scale of your charactersâ€¦ You can also control the properties of a shader or a material, collider sizes, the life of a character, or any statistic you could imagine.

the animation tools work a bit like an interface to the set method. That's how it can control anything.
You can use it for characters, user interface, for any interactive elements in the game, but also to animate collider's, to set flags, to playback sounds, et cetera

how to call functions from the animation
while you could call back a function after a certain amount of time, using a coroutine, the animation editor allows you to do it visually, in a way that designer friendly.
With the animation player note, you can animate any property on any node inside of your scene.
Download the example project:
let us first add an animation player node.
When you select the animation player, the animation tab opens up at the bottom of the viewport. This is where you will create, name, Doug McKay,
this is where you will creeds and manage animations.
Group 3.0, there is no fall rating system. Ingrid 3.0, you don't have the for traditional animation workflow. Ingrid 3.0, there is no separation between the setup and the animation. Ingrid 3.0, there is no separation between the rigging (set the setup), and the boozing mode itself. Because of that, you must always create a rest posed that will reinitialise your characters properties.
You can animate characters, collider's, sound, play sound, shaders, and anything you like. All the animation player does is get a bath to a certain node and property, and call the set method on it.
The animation tools are not on the for animation: they are an alternative
they are a visual alternative to coroutines.
You can even animate
can even call functions from the animation tour, using the dedicated function call track. Use that to create frame events. You will use that to play sounds, or create frame events.
